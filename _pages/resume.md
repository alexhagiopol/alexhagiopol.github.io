### Expertise
* Technical Leadership (listening and influencing, roadmap development and execution, talent development).
* Software Engineering (modern C++, CUDA, Python, systems design, implementation, optimization, code review, refactoring, unit testing, large codebase maintenance, version control).
* Research and Development (scientific literature review, algorithm development, algorithm implementation, algorithm evaluation, technical communication in reports and presentations).

### Experience
*[Meta](https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/)*                  	                
* Software Engineer, Meta Reality Labs                             
* Mar 2020 - Present
* San Francisco Bay Area, CA
* Contributed technical leadership and production software to unannounced augmented reality products.
* Designed and implemented a software system that unblocked product development for a 100+ person org across 5+ engineering teams. Delivered a real time, modern C++ and CUDA algorithm pipeline that emulates the behavior of algorithms implemented in physical silicon. Enabled augmented reality product developers to do their work 1+ years before physical silicon availability. Shipped this system to its users and provided support to ensure success.
* Led the system’s development which included collecting user needs, doing most of the design and implementation, and reviewing code changes from 30+ engineers who also contributed. Designed and implemented the system’s architecture and made key contributions in areas such as a linear systems solver, a computational geometry library, a depth estimation algorithm, a machine learning based segmentation algorithm, and a visualization subsystem. 
* Produced a >800X end-to-end performance improvement by reimplementing and refactoring legacy components: before I joined to lead the project, my org considered such a system infeasible to implement in real time. 
* Developed my team’s technical expertise on topics such as modern C++ concurrency, CUDA performance optimization, and computer vision algorithms. 
* Led my org’s engineering standards committee. Designed the engineering documentation system used by my 55+ person org. Designed the software quality practices used by my immediate 10 person team. Individually mentored 25+ engineers on programming and documentation standards.

*[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mixed-reality)*                     
* Software Engineer, AI Perception and Mixed Reality Group                  
* Oct 2017 - Nov 2019
* San Francisco Bay Area, CA
* Developed scientific research papers into features for [HoloLens 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/buy). Contributed machine learning and computer vision research in addition to production software in modern C++, CUDA, Python, and TensorFlow.
* Designed and implemented my org’s core computer vision technology. Created a GPU-accelerated dense 3D scene reconstruction system. Designed and implemented math algorithms in the following areas: linear algebra, image processing, computational geometry, computer vision, and machine learning. This replaced a legacy implementation in 20X fewer lines of code with 10X faster performance.
* Designed and implemented a machine learning system for high-precision segmentation system based on research in statistical learning and deep learning. Advanced the group’s state-of-the-art in the problem domain and published a granted patent, [US10902608B2 Segmentation for Holographic Images](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10902608B2). 
* Maintained, refactored, and unit tested multi-million line legacy algorithm codebases as the code moved from research to production. Created a unit testing system, removed over 3 million lines of C++ and CUDA code through refactoring, and converted the codebases’ version control systems from deprecated internal tools to Git.

*[NASA](https://www.nasa.gov)*                          
* Research Intern, Autonomy Incubator Group                
* May 2015 - May 2016
* Hampton, VA & Remote
* Contributed computer vision research and software to an early prototype of [NASA's Ingenuity Mars helicopter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingenuity_(helicopter)). 
* Investigated computer vision based localization techniques applied to NASA’s prototype robots for Mars exploration. Contributed software implementations, literature research, and visualization tools for performance evaluation.
* Developed a 3D reconstruction system based on multi-object tracking and numerical optimization of 3D poses. Implemented region-of-interest detection, region tracking, optimization mathematics, and visualization pipeline in C++.
