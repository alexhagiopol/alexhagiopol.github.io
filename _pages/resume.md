### Expertise
* Technical Leadership (listening and influencing, roadmap development and execution, talent development).
* Software Engineering (modern C++, CUDA, Python, systems design, implementation, optimization, code review, refactoring, unit testing, large codebase maintenance, version control).
* Research and Development (scientific literature review, algorithm development, algorithm implementation, algorithm evaluation, technical communication in reports and presentations).

### Experience
*[Facebook](https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/)*                  	                
* Software Engineer, Facebook Reality Labs                             
* Mar 2020 - Present
* San Francisco Bay Area, CA
* Contributed technical leadership and production-grade software to Oculus augmented reality products.
* Designed and implemented mathematical software that unblocked product development for a 100+ person effort across 5+ engineering teams. Delivered a real time, modern C++ and CUDA algorithm pipeline that emulates the behavior of algorithms implemented in physical silicon. Enabled augmented reality product developers to do their work 1+ years before physical silicon availability. Shipped this system to its users and provided support to ensure success.
* Led the pipeline’s development which included collecting user needs, doing most of the design and implementation, and reviewing code changes from 30+ engineers who also contributed. Designed and implemented the pipeline’s architecture and made key contributions in areas such as a linear systems solver, a computational geometry library, a depth estimation algorithm, a machine learning based segmentation algorithm, and a visualization system. 
* Produced a >500X end-to-end performance improvement by reimplementing and refactoring legacy components: before I joined to lead the project, my organization considered such a pipeline infeasible to implement in real time. 
* Developed my team’s technical expertise on topics such as modern C++ concurrency, CUDA performance optimization, and computer vision algorithms. 
* Led my organizations’s engineering standards committee. Designed the engineering documentation system used by my 55+ person organization. Designed the software quality practices used by my immediate 10 person team. Individually mentored 25+ engineers on programming and documentation standards.

*[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mixed-reality)*                     
* Software Engineer, AI Perception and Mixed Reality Group                  
* Oct 2017 - Nov 2019
* San Francisco Bay Area, CA
* Developed scientific research papers into features for the [HoloLens 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/buy) augmented reality headset. Contributed machine learning and computer vision research in addition to production software in modern C++, CUDA, and Python.
* Designed and implemented my organization’s core computer vision technology in the form of a GPU-accelerated dense 3D scene reconstruction system. Designed and implemented the core mathematical algorithms in the following areas: linear algebra, image processing, computational geometry, computer vision, and machine learning. This work replaced a legacy GPU implementation in 20X fewer lines of code and achieved 10X faster performance.
* Designed and implemented a machine learning system for high-precision segmentation system based on research in statistical learning and deep learning. Advanced the group’s state-of-the-art in the problem domain and sole-authored a granted patent, [US10902608B2 Segmentation for Holographic Images](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10902608B2). Designed and implemented the core statistical learning algorithms in C++ and CUDA. Leveraged Python and TensorFlow for neural network components.
* Maintained, refactored, and unit tested legacy algorithm codebases as the code moved from research to production. Created a unit testing system, removed over 3 million lines of C++ and CUDA code through refactoring, and converted the codebases’ version control systems from deprecated internal tools to Git.

*[DroneDeploy](https://www.dronedeploy.com)*                                    
* Software Engineer, Computer Vision Group                                            
* May 2016 - June 2017
* San Francisco Bay Area, CA
* Contributed to a C++ computational geometry engine that computes 3D maps using 2D drone-captured imagery.
* Contributed C++ software features yielding a 3D mapping reliability increase from < 50% to 99.9% in 8 months without affecting result quality or computation speed.
* Contributed new product features including neural network based classifier for map regions of interest, and fast 2D map preview using feature detection, feature matching, and image transformations.

*[NASA](https://www.nasa.gov)*                          
* Research Intern, Autonomy Incubator Group                
* May 2015 - May 2016
* Hampton, VA & Remote
* Researched and implemented computer vision and machine learning algorithms applied to autonomous robotics.
* Investigated computer vision based localization techniques applied to NASA’s prototype robots for Mars exploration. Contributed implementation improvements, literature research, and visualization tools for performance evaluation.
* Developed a 3D reconstruction system based on multi-object tracking and numerical optimization of 3D poses. Implemented region-of-interest detection, region tracking, optimization mathematics, visualization pipeline in C++. Presented results at AIAA conference and to NASA leadership which led to earning grant funding for my M.Sc. studies.
