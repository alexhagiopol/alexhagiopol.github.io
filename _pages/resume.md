### Expertise

* Technical Leadership (roadmap development and execution, cross-functional listening and influencing, developing engineering talent).
* Programming (modern C++, CUDA, and Python). 
* Software Engineering (systems design, implementation, optimization, code review, refactoring, unit testing, large codebase maintenance, version control).
* Research and Development (scientific literature review, algorithm development, algorithm implementation, algorithm evaluation, technical communication in reports and presentations).

### Experience

*[Facebook](https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/)*                  	                
* Software Engineer, Facebook Reality Labs                             
* Mar 2020 - Present
* San Francisco Bay Area, CA

* Contributed technical leadership and production software to Oculus augmented reality products. 
* Designed and implemented mathematical software that unblocked product development for a 100+ person effort across 5+ engineering teams. This took the form of a real time, modern C++ and CUDA algorithm pipeline that emulates the behavior of algorithms implemented in physical silicon. This software allowed augmented reality product developers to do their work ~2 years before physical silicon availability.
* Led the pipeline’s development which included collecting user needs, doing most of the design and implementation, and reviewing code changes from 30+ engineers who made major and minor contributions over 1+ years of development and use. Designed and implemented the pipeline’s architecture as well making key contributions to major sub-components such as a linear systems solver, a computational geometry library, a computer vision based scene reconstruction algorithm, a machine learning based image segmentation algorithm, and a visualization system. Refactored legacy components and produced a >500X end-to-end performance improvement: before I joined to lead the project, the organization considered such a pipeline infeasible to implement in real time. Developed the my team’s technical expertise on topics such as modern C++ concurrency, CUDA performance optimization, and computer vision algorithms. Shipped this system to its users and provided support to ensure their (and their organizations’) success.
* Led my organizations’s engineering standards committee. Designed the engineering documentation system used by my 55+ person organization. Designed the software quality practices used by my immediate 10 person team. Individually mentored 25+ engineers on programming and documentation standards.

*[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mixed-reality)*                     
* Software Engineer, AI Perception and Mixed Reality Group                  
* Oct 2017 - Nov 2019
* San Francisco Bay Area, CA

* Collaborated with Microsoft Research (MSR) to develop scientific research papers into features for the [HoloLens 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/buy) augmented reality headset. Contributed machine learning and computer vision research in addition to production software in modern C++, CUDA, and Python.
* Designed and implemented my organization’s core computer vision technology in the form of a GPU-accelerated dense 3D scene reconstruction system. Designed and implemented the core mathematical algorithms in the following areas: linear algebra, image processing, computational geometry, computer vision, and machine learning. This work replaced a legacy technology in 20X fewer lines of code and achieved 10X faster performance.
* Designed and implemented a machine learning system for high-precision segmentation system based on research in statistical learning and deep learning. Advanced the group’s state-of-the-art in the problem domain and sole-authored a granted patent, [US10902608B2 Segmentation for Holographic Images](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10902608B2). Designed and implemented the core statistical learning algorithms in C++ and CUDA. Leveraged Python and TensorFlow for neural network components.
* Maintained, refactored, and unit tested MSR algorithm codebases as the code moved from research to production. Created a unit testing system, removed over 3 million lines of C++ and CUDA code through refactoring, and converted the codebases’ version control systems from deprecated internal tools to Git.

*[DroneDeploy](https://www.dronedeploy.com)*                                    
* Software Engineer, Computer Vision Group                                            
* May 2016 - June 2017
* San Francisco Bay Area, CA

* Contributed to a C++ computational geometry engine that computes 3D maps using 2D drone-captured imagery.
* Contributed C++ software features yielding a 3D mapping reliability increase from < 50% to 99.9% in 8 months without affecting result quality or computation speed.
* Contributed new product features including neural network based classifier for map regions of interest, and fast 2D map preview using feature detection, feature matching, and image transformations.
