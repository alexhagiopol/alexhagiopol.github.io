I develop new technologies at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/){:target="_blank"}. We work to make [scientific research breakthroughs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYrJJNdrEg) useful to the many people who use Meta's products every day. Previously, my career spanned Silicon Valley startups, Microsoft, and NASA where I contributed to efforts such as the [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens){:target="_blank"} and the [NASA Mars Helicopter](https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/){:target="_blank"}. I generally like working at the intersection of math, code, and leadership.
