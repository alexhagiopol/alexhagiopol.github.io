I am a software engineer specializing in computer vision research and development at Facebook Reality Labs. I contribute to the design and implementation of core technologies underpinning Oculus and Portal products. Previously, I was a software engineer in Microsoft's A.I. Perception and Mixed Reality organization. At Microsoft, I developed several computer vision technologies including a GPU accelerated dense 3D reconstuction system for photorealistic human avatar creation. Before Microsoft, I studied computer science at Georgia Tech while doing NASA-funded robotics research under Prof. Frank Dellaert. I hold B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from Georgia Tech.

I'm an expert in software engineering using C++ 17, Python, and CUDA. A Silicon Valley veteran engineer, I have designed and implemented production-grade codebases from the ground up in all three languages. In parallel with architecting new systems from the ground up, I've also refactored and maintained multi-million line legacy codebases in all three languages. I'm an advocate for software engineering excellece at Facebook which includes leading my team's engineering quality committee. My favorite software contributions are code deletion and unit tests.

I specialize in algorithm development in the areas of classical and machine learning based computer vision. I've created several state-of-the-art implementations in these domains for both academic and commercial purposes during my career. To provide examples of my work in these fields, my [GitHub page](https://github.com/alexhagiopol) presents open source software while my [Research page](https://alexhagiopol.github.io/research/) presents my writings and presentations.
