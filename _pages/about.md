I develop augmented reality technologies at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/){:target="_blank"}. At Meta, I lead efforts to ship scientific research into software and hardware consumer products. Before Meta, my career spanned Silicon Valley startups, Microsoft, and NASA where I contributed to efforts such as the [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens){:target="_blank"} and the [NASA Mars Helicopter](https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/){:target="_blank"}. I like working at the intersection of math and code and spent most of my career designing and (efficiently) implementing classical and machine learning based algorithms.
