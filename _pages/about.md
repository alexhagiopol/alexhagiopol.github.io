I research and develop augmented reality technologies at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/). Before Meta, my career spanned Silicon Valley startups, Microsoft, and NASA where I contributed to high-profile efforts such as the [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens) and the [NASA Mars Helicopter](https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/).

I've focused my career on algorithm development in classical and machine learning based computer vision, although I excel generally at the intersection of math and code. My interest is efficient implementation of the mathematical primitives and formulas at the heart of state-of-the-art algorithms. I especially enjoy parallel programming on CPUs and GPUs. 

My open source software is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/alexhagiopol), and my writings are available on my [Research page](https://alexhagiopol.github.io/research/).
