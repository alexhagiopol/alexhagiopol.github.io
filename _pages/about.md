I develop augmented reality technologies at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/). At Meta, I lead efforts to ship scientific research into software and hardware consumer products. Before Meta, my career spanned Silicon Valley startups, Microsoft, and NASA where I contributed to efforts such as the [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens) and the [NASA Mars Helicopter](https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/). I've focused my career on architecting software systems that efficiently implement classical and machine learning based algorithms. I excel generally at the intersection of math and code and especially enjoy parallel programming on CPUs and GPUs. As a leader, I operate with intense candor, deep care for my team's wellbeing, and love for the craft.
