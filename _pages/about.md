I'm a software engineer at Facebook Reality Labs where I design and implement technologies underpinning Oculus products. Before Facebook, my career spanned Silicon Valley startups, Microsoft, and NASA. I've focused my career on algorithm development in the areas of classical and machine learning based computer vision. My specific interest is efficient implementation of the mathematical primitives and formulas at the heart of state-of-the-art algorithms. I excel at the intersection of math and code. I especially enjoy GPU programming and parallel programming in general. 

I'm an expert in software engineering using modern C++, Python, and CUDA. I have architected, implemented, and shipped industrial-strength codebases in all three languages. Additionally, I have maintained multi-million line legacy codebases in all three languages. I'm an advocate for software engineering excellence at Facebook which includes leading my organization's programming standards committee. My favorite software contributions are code deletion and unit tests.

My open source software is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/alexhagiopol), and my writings are available on my [Research page](https://alexhagiopol.github.io/research/).
