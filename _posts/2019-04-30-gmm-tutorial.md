Theory and implementation of Gaussian Mixture Models and the Expectation Maximization Algorithm.

### Description:

This [.PDF technical report](/content/gmm_tutorial.pdf){:target="_blank"} describes the mathematics theory and programming implementation of Gaussian Mixture Models and Expectation Maximization applied to image segmentation. I found myself needing to implement an image segmentation algorithm, but did not have the requisite training data to reproduce state-of-the-art methods in the domain. This motivated me to study the application of Gaussian Mixture Models, a classical machine learning approach that - while unable to produce state-of-the-art results - is fully unsupervised and does not require training data. The accompanying [Python reference implementation](https://github.com/alexhagiopol/gmm){:target="_blank"} is available on my GitHub page.
