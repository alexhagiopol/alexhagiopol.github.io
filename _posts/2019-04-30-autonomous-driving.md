Training a neural network to drive a car along a virtual track.

### Description:

I created a Python implementation of the 2016 paper [End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316.pdf) by Bojarski et al. The implementation reproduces the results of the paper in a driving simulation constructed in the Unity game engine. The full code, installation instructions, and technical report are on [the project's GitHub page](https://github.com/alexhagiopol/end-to-end-deep-learning).
