My most popular GitHub project: C++ and Python solutions to *Cracking the Coding Interview*.

### Description:

I created [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/alexhagiopol/cracking-the-coding-interview) where I write solutions to every problem in the computer science interview bible, *Cracking the Coding Interview*, in Python and C++. Furthermore, I produce the solutions with the highest level of engineering rigor I can attain: they have > 90% unit test coverage and an automatic build and testing system that verifies every solution any time code is changed. This project has gained the most public attention of any of my work on GitHub by an order of magnitude: it has over 400 stars, > 100 forks, and a place in the first page GitHub search results for the title of the textbook.
