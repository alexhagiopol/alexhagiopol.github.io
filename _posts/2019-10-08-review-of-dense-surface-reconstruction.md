Presentation slides for in-depth tech talk on dense 3D point cloud reconstruction from 2D images.

### Description:

This [PDF presentation](/content/dense-surface-reconstruction.pdf) is a talk I have given at several venues that provides an overview of the topic of dense 3D surface reconstruction 2D images. It includes 30 literature references on subtopics of the overview including many landmark papers in computer vision. The presentation covers both theory and implementation aspects of 3D surface reconstruction including discussions on camera calibration, disparity estimation, and 3D point cloud generation.
